# Ivan Sutherland's "The Ultimate Display"

In this short text, Sutherland defines what the ultimate form of computer display would be, to him, with his reference being the current state of the art in terms of display at the time of writing the text (1965).

Note: this manifesto came 3 years before Sutherland revealed his ground-breaking "Sword of Damocles" display, which he is most known for. This display is widely considered to be the first-ever Augmented Reality display.

# What Ivan got right and wrong

## Correct predictions

Obviously, in 1965, almost 60 years ago, the technology to support complex display systems was merely emerging. Nevertheless, Ivan got some things right on what developments followed in the history of display after 1965:

* Force feedback controls directly address Ivan's remark "The force required to move a joystick could be computer controlled".
* "Tomorrow's computer user will interact with a computer through a typewriter" refers to the keyboard I am still using to write this post.
* "It is likely that new display equipment will have area-filling capability" does predict the fact current displays can produce any HD image conceivable
* "Point and drag" gestures are common in every interface now, usually known as drag-and-drop.
* "A display connected to a digital computer gives us a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world" truly anticipates virtual reality, where users can interact with fully simulated environments.
* "Machines to sense and interpret eye motion data can and will be built" foreshadows today's eye-tracking technologies (used in VR headsets and HCI research).


## Inaccurate ones

* "New displays with analog memories may well lose the pointing ability altogether": thankfully, Ivan could not have been more wrong. Every computing device in our century, be it a touch screen or a device with a mouse, combines memory storage in a hard drive or flash memory-type unit, with a pointing device, which can be a touchpad, a mouse, or the user's finger in the case of touch screens. It is actually quite hard to imagine a device which does not combine both.
* "So far only the muscles of the hands and arms have been used for computer control. There is no reason why these should be the only ones" was too optimistic. While control technologies exist for other muscles, hand controls remain the dominant methods due to their ease of use.
* "It remains to be seen if we can use a language of glances to control a computer" didn't really work out. Though eye-tracking is an existing technology, glances are too subtle for most devices to track accurately.

The last paragraph describing the ultimate display as "the Wonderland into which Alice walked", where Ivan states "a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal", is quite chilling -- but it also goes to show how far we still are from this ultimate display.
