_Task: Enhancing human abilities in the age of augmented reality._

Steps: 
- Ideation: create, sketch & present 3 ideas
- Prototyping: build a prototype that is good enough to have a first user exposure
- Evaluate: ask someone to interact with our prototype; observe and discuss with them what their opinion is towards our concept and interaction; critically reflect.

# Idea 1: AI Equation Helper

## The Concept

As a former "pr√©pa" student, I have been stuck countless times on math or physics problems, but finding help for them is often non-trivial. Apart from asking the teacher or a friend, it could be useful to have an assistant which helps us understand what possibilities we have and what are the usual methods to solve X or Y problem. A LLM could be trained to focus on math/physics/chemistry/engineering problems, with knowledge of the classic ways of solving classic problems. One of the issues is also the fact many math or physics exercises contain greek or non-latin letters. To help with the tedious task of copying and pasting half of the greek alphabet, an advanced OCR algorithm could let us scan our writing with our phone, including the non-latin letters, and append LLM chatbot ideas at the end of the page. The interface would be similar to Google Translate's live translation features, with simple text boxes pinned to the right parts of the page thanks to motion tracking. 

I believe such a tool would simplify web searches in the context of science problems. Of course, this tool is only for learning, and is forbidden during tests!

# Idea 2: Piano Assistant

When I was in music school, I took two years of piano classes, and during those two years, the teacher would keep telling me to better position my hands. In a similar fashion to the previous example, I believe simple motion tracking and specific AI/neural network training can go a long way to help musicians have better posture: in this case, we train the AI to recognize and correct hand poses while the person is playing, with the phone held by the teacher or somebody else. Motion tracking is performed on the hands to ensure continuous analysis of their shape, and on the piano to keep track of its relative position to the hands. 

Of course, this is merely an example case of a broader class of apps, which could be used for other instruments, sports, or even military training.
