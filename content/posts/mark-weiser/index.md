# Are we already living in a world of Ubiquitous Computing (UC)?

First off, one must acknowledge that Weiser's definition of the Personal Computer is still very much a thing. This article was typed on one! Even smartphones are not really embedded into the environment, they are just a light, transportable version of the Personal Computer. That being said, the fact they are lightweight and can be carried anywhere does make them already closer to being part of UC: we have them on us all the time, and not carrying your smartphone just _feels wrong_ nowadays. 

IoT devices are the most well-known example of modern, sort-of-ubiquitous computing. Thanks to **cloud storage**, **good Internet coverage** (though this aspect is debatable in certain parts of the world) and **better battery efficiency**, **wearable** devices (watches, glasses...) can run for a long amount of time and give us access to everything we need, practically anywhere. They are much more "invisible" than computers and smartphones, making them closer to Weiser's definition of UC. There is also hope with recent developments of distributed systems.

Smartphones and wearable devices also embody Weiser's idea of computers adapting to their environment: smartphones use gyroscopes to sense when to rotate the screen, light sensors to adjust screen brightness, and the camera usually has an almost fully automatic pipeline for adjusting exposure time, focal length etc.; wearable devices usually have a GPS sensor on them as well, providing real-time geolocation.

# What needs yet to happen so we get closer to UC?

To fully reach UC, several advancements are still necessary. Improved **interoperability** across platforms is essential to ensure that all devices can communicate seamlessly, regardless of manufacturer. A greater **context awareness** is also crucial, as current systems lack the ability to adapt to nuanced user needs in real time. **Privacy and security** must be significantly imporved to protect against constant data tracking, with strong encryption and clear data policies. **Power efficiency** needs to improve for smaller, embedded devices to function independently over long periods, perhaps through renewable (or wireless) charging. Furthermore, **social and ethical frameworks** are needed to address concerns about data privacy, and potential overreach, fostering a technology landscape that prioritizes human-centered values. Lastly, expanding **Augmented Reality** as an overlay for physical environments will help bridge the gap between digital and real worlds, moving closer to Weiser's vision of _embodied virtuality_.

For Weiser’s vision to materialize, technology must not only evolve but also fade further into the background. Scalable, global networks are required to support interconnected devices everywhere, along with a shift away from screen-centric interfaces toward more ambient, environmental computing. Although many foundational elements are present, the ultimate goal is a world where technology enhances daily life unobtrusively, serving users’ needs without demanding constant attention or compromising privacy.
