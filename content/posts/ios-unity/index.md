## Installation

i had a feeling windows 11, unity, and my 6-year-old iphone xr would struggle to coexist. i could install unity remote 5 on my device just fine, connect it to my computer and change the build settings in unity so that it builds on ios; but since my phone doesn't have any "developer mode", it was impossible for unity to detect my phone.

i installed itunes, as it is needed to connect a computer to an ios device, but to no avail. despite itunes detecting my phone, unity did not.

i created an apple developer account; but it turns out one has to pay for a subscription in order to add a trusted device in their apple developer account, which i did not do.

## It started working (all i had to do was restart my computer)...

my phone does show up in the device list now. the lesson today is that my assumptions about my setup being bound to fail were untrue. i feel like when i code, i am so used to seeing errors pop up that i just assume things will not work. i still think it is the right mindset to have, so one doesn't have negative surprises when things don't work, but being a little more hopeful could perhaps benefit me.

## ...But it refused

this time i don't know what went wrong. my computer, itunes and unity all detect my phone, but when i launch the game, it plays on my computer, not on my phone. 
i had to follow the lab with a classmate who has a Mac and an iphone, which are more compatible than windows and ios.
