## Killed by Google

Google is famous for discontinuing products and services, whenever they do not succeed as much as they would like. This has been the case for Google+, Google Domains, ... The website [Killed by Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/) actually lists all the items that were "killed by Google".

A famous example is the Google Glass: a pair of "smart" glasses which performs augmented reality visualization.

## What happens when a company's vision is not 10/10

Back when it was introduced to the public in 2014, the mere concept of Google Glass posed some privacy concerns, on top of Google being already known as a questionable company in regard to user data & privacy. Wearing a camera on one's eyes 24/7 does not _feel_ right. Constant surveillance is already an issue, and this would certainly not help. 

Google also marketed it as a luxury item and attempted to build a community of Google Glass users.

**Overall, it seemed that people found smartphones and other conventional devices to be more attractive and practical. Even if we rarely do it, a smartphone _can_ be put away for a while, whereas glasses are meant to be worn all day.**

A short burst of interest for smart glasses in the public rose again in 2019, and the Glass was available again for a moment, before Google killed it again due to its lack of popularity.
