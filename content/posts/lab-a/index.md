## Setting up the blog

we used the Hugo framework and GitHub's hosting services. i knew about the latter but Hugo was something new for me. i must admit, it was also nice to have my memory refreshed a bit on the usual git commands... i only remembered `commit` and `push`...

```console
git status
git add .
git commit -m "my commit message"
git push -u origin main
```

## Images are tricky

they are. but the 2nd method in [this one stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71501256/how-to-insert-an-image-in-my-post-on-hugo) works perfectly

!["if youre reading this then i messed up and the image is not showing up :("](images/thumbsup.jpg) 





## And now...

...now to add some content to it...
